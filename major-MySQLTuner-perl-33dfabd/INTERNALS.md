## MySQLTuner get login information steps

* Is a login possible?
    * Force socket?
    * Remote connection?
        * _Specifying available RAM is required_
    * Got user/pass on command line?
    * mysql-quickbackup credentials available?
    * Plesk credentials available?
    * DirectAdmin credentials available?
    * Debian maintenance account credentials available?
    * Just try a login
        * If working, and .my.cnf isn't there, **WARNING**
        * If working, and .my.cnf is there, okay
    * Prompt for creds on the console

## MySQLTuner system checks
* 32-bit w/>2GB RAM check
* Check number of opened ports (warning if more than 9 ports opened)
* Check 80, 8080, 443 and 8443 ports if warning are raised if there are opened 
* Check if some banned ports are not opened (option --bannedports separated by comma)
* Check if non kernel and user process except mysqld are not using more than 15% of total physical memory)
* Check vm.swapiness
* Check /etc/security/limit.conf
* Check sysctl entries: sunrpc.tcp_slot_entries, vm.swappiness, fs.aio-fs-nr
* Check mount point
* Check Ethernet card
* Check load average

## MySQLTuner Server version checks
* EOL MySQL version check
* Currently MySQL < 5.1 are EOF considerated.
* Using 5.5+ version of MySQL for performance issue (asynchronous IO).

## MySQL Storage engine general information

* Get storage engine counts/stats
    * Check for DB engines that are enabled but unused
    * Look for fragmented tables
    * Look for auto-increments near capacity
    	* Look for table with autoincrement with value near max capacity

## MySQLTuner security checks

* Is anonymous user present?
* Users without passwords
* Users w/username as password
* Users w/o host restriction
* Weak password check (possibly using cracklib later?)
* Using basic_passwords.txt as password database
* Password list checks can be avoid (option: --skippassword) 

## MySQLTuner CVE vulnerabilities detection

* option: --cvefile
* Check if your MariaDB or MySQL version contains CVE bulletins.

## MySQLTuner database information

	* Percentage of index size
        * Collation number
        * Check that there is only one collation for all table in a database
        * Check that there is only one collation for ll table columns in a database
        * Check that there is only one storage engine per user database


## MySQLTuner index information

* Per index information
	* Index Cardinality
	* Index Selectivity
	* Misc information about index definition 
	* Misc information about index size

## MySQLTuner Connections information

* Highest usage of available connections
* Percentage of used connections (<85%)
* Percentage of aborted connections (<3%)

## MySQLTuner server information

* Uptime: If MySQL started within last 24 hours

* Percentage of sort using temporary table (<10%)
* Number of join performed without using indexes (<250)
* Percentage of temporary table written on disk(<25%)
* Thread cache (=4)
* Thread cache hit ratio (>50%) if thread_handling is different of pools-of-threads
* Table cache hit ratio(>2Â°%)
* Percentage of open file and open file limit(<85%)

* InnoDB Buffer Pool Size
   * If possible, innodb_buffer_pool_size should be greater data and index size for Innodb Table
   * Innodb_buffer_pool_size should around 75 to 80 % of the available system memory.
* InnoDB Buffer Pool Instances

   * Ratio of write without locks
* InnoDB Log Waits
   * Checks that no lock is used on Innodb Log.
